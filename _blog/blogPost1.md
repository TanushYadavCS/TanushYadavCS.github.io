This is the very first post on this blog. A few things I wish to highlight are:
- I'll be maintaining a journal of all the things I learn in the future here.
- I'll make sure to explain everything that I do and post the code as well.
- Each post will be tagged and categorized.
- My main intention with this blog is to track my own ML journey. But, if you somehow find yourself here I will try my best to make this a useful resource for you.

Having cleared these things out, I hope you find this blog to be worth your time. Enjoy!
