As a computer science undergraduate with a strong passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence, I am eager to gain hands-on experience and deepen my expertise in these cutting-edge fields. 
I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, collaborate with experienced professionals, and contribute to innovative projects.
