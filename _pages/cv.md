## Experience

### Binary Bots | Lotus Valley International School 2021
- Created an inter-school coding competition by the name of ProCodr and led a team which fully automated the competition on Discord with the help of scripted bots. The competition was entirely executed on Discord with the bots compiling user entered programs and awarding points based on the code’s output.

### Hackathons | Manipal University, Jaipur September 2022 – March 2024
- **HackX 2023**: Took part in the HackX Hackathon. Created a working prototype of a social media application for startup founders where they could interact, meet up, ideate and pitch ideas to each other.
- **Turing Sapiens Hackathon 2023**: Participated in the Turing Sapiens Hackathon where I programmed an API which has the capability to rate news articles on various factors. This API could be used to check if the news articles you read are legitimate or not.
- **Randomize() Hackathon 2024**: Participated in the Randomize() Hackathon where I developed an attendance tracking application for students. This application has the capability to keep track of your attendance and provide insights about your activity based on that information.

### Project Internship (Upcoming) | iNeuron May 2024 – July 2024
- Interning at iNeuron where I’ll work on a machine learning project for 2.5 months.
- The project is an AI-powered data analysis system which will automate data analysis, generate insights, and enhance the decision-making process by using LLMs.

## Education

**Manipal University, Jaipur BTech CSE (Hons. in AI/ML)**           
Ongoing (August 2022 – May 2026)

## Projects

### Guitar Tuner | Python August 2023
- Coded a basic guitar tuning application in Python using the concept of pitch recognition and sound input libraries.
- Used Python along with libraries like sounddevice, numpy, and scipy to make a simple DFT guitar tuner.

### Sign Language Translation Model | Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV August 2023
- Developed a sign language translation model that uses a webcam to detect a user’s hand signs and translates them to English.
- Achieved by using TensorFlow for model training and OpenCV for camera vision capabilities.

### Student Attendance Tracking Application | Dart, Flutter, Firebase November 2023
- Built an attendance tracking application for students to help keep track of their attendance in various courses.
- Made use of the Flutter framework to build the app’s front-end and Firebase as the back-end for data management and processing.

### Hand Gesture Controlled Drone (Ongoing) | LUA, Arduino, Betaflight, ELRS February 2024
- Currently developing a drone which can be controlled by the tilt of your hand along the three axes.
- Achieved by using a gyroscope to detect continuous tilt data and parse it into transmittable controller data to be sent to the drone.
